# 🎯 JobPrep AI – Intelligent Interview Preparation Platform

**JobPrep AI** is an AI-powered interview preparation platform built entirely on **Snowflake Data Cloud**. It transforms fragmented interview questions, company-specific expectations, and role-based preparation material into a unified, intelligent system that helps candidates prepare in a focused and outcome-driven way.

The platform integrates structured data engineering pipelines, vector search, semantic retrieval, and AI-driven reasoning to simulate interviews, evaluate responses, and provide personalized guidance.

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Job seekers often face inefficient and one-size-fits-all interview preparation.

Candidates struggle to:

- Identify role-specific expectations
- Practice realistic interview scenarios
- Assess their readiness objectively
- Focus on actual weaknesses
- Connect scattered preparation resources

Traditional preparation methods are **fragmented**, **static**, and **not adaptive**.

## 💡 Solution Overview

JobPrep AI provides an intelligent interview preparation assistant that:

- **Centralizes** job-specific interview data
- **Simulates** realistic interview experiences
- **Uses semantic search** to retrieve relevant questions
- **Evaluates** responses using AI
- **Delivers** structured, personalized feedback
- **Guides** candidates with actionable improvement steps

The result is a **focused**, **adaptive**, and **confidence-driven** preparation experience.
